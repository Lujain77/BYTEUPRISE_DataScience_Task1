Generate a bar chart or histogram to visually represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the age distribution or gender composition within a population. This graphical representation offers a clear and insightful overview of the data's patterns and trends.



Introduction : 

Visualizing data is crucial for understanding patterns and trends within datasets. Two common types of visualizations are histograms and bar charts, each suited for different types of data.

Histogram for Continuous Variable (x1) : 

A histogram is used to display the distribution of a continuous variable, such as age or income. It divides the data into bins and shows the frequency of observations within each bin.

    plt.title('Distribution of x1')
    plt.xlabel('x1')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.grid(True)
    ```
  - Display the plot: `plt.show()`

Bar Chart for Categorical Variable (y): 

A bar chart is ideal for visualizing the counts of categories within a categorical variable, such as gender or type of product purchased.


    plt.title('Counts of y Categories')
    plt.xlabel('y')
    plt.ylabel('Count')
    plt.grid(True)
    ```
  - Display the plot: `plt.show()`

Conclusion : 

Using histograms and bar charts provides insightful visual representations that aid in understanding data distributions and categorical compositions.
